Tic Tac Toe Game in Java:
A Tic Tac Toe game created using Java typically involves both front-end (user interface) and back-end (game logic) components. Hereâ€™s an overview of the different aspects involved in developing such a game:

1. Game Logic
The core logic of the Tic Tac Toe game involves managing the game state, checking for win conditions, and handling player moves. This can be implemented using a 2D array to represent the game board.

Key Components for code of the game :

Game Board: A 3x3 array (e.g., char[][] board = new char[3][3]) that keeps track of the moves. Empty cells can be represented by a space ' ', player X's moves by 'X', and player O's moves by 'O'.
Player Turn: A variable to keep track of whose turn it is (e.g., a boolean isXTurn).
Win Conditions: Methods to check if there is a winner or if the game is a draw. This involves checking rows, columns, and diagonals for three matching symbols.
Move Validation: Ensuring that moves are made in empty cells and within the bounds of the board.

2. User Interface
The user interface can be created using Java Swing for a graphical interface or the console for a text-based interface.

Swing-based GUI:

JFrame: The main window of the application.
JPanel: Panels to hold the game board and other components like buttons and labels.
JButton: Buttons representing the cells of the board. Each button's action listener updates the game state and UI.
JLabel: To display game status messages (e.g., whose turn it is, win/draw messages).
Console-based UI:

Print Statements: To display the board and prompts for player input.
Scanner: To read player input from the console.

3. Classes and Methods
Class Structure:

TicTacToe: Main class to initialize the game and manage the game loop.
Board: Class to handle board operations like updating the board, checking for a win or draw, and displaying the board.
Player: Class (or methods) to handle player moves and switch turns.
